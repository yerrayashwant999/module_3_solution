				<div class="content">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl. As one of the most common and widespread domestic animals with a population of more than 24 billion in 2003, there are more chickens in the world than any other species of bird. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming both their meat and their eggs. The traditional poultry farming view of the domestication of the chicken is stated in Encyclopædia Britannica (2007): "Humans first domesticated chickens of Indian origin for the purpose of cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Very little formal attention was given to egg or meat production... "Recent genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in Southeast, East, and South Asia, but with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From India the domesticated fowl made its way to the Persianized kingdom of Lydia in western Asia Minor, and domestic fowl were imported to Greece by the fifth century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the 18th Dynasty, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar.</div><a href="#top" class="arrange"> Go to Top</a>

				<div class="content">Beef is raised and/or eaten in most countries of the world. It’s price and frequency of consumption varies depending on availability. In the US it is readily available and relatively cheap; this is why we eat quite a bit. In other parts of the world like Japan it is difficult to raise due to limited space so it eaten less often and is very expensive. During butchering each animal is divided into large “chunks” called primals. In butcher shops and some high-end restaurants you will find personnel who can butcher a whole side of beef. But in today’s supermarkets you will find people called meat cutters who do not cut beef from the side. They only break down beef from these large primal cuts into fabricated cuts that are sold at the retail level. Each primal yields specific market cuts. As animals move about in the field they exercise their muscles, on a beef the front shoulder area gets a lot of muscle activity. The rear of the animal also gets a lot of movement, but since they walk around forward the front gets more. The most muscle development and consequently the toughest meats, happens in the front legs of the beef. The amount of fat accumulation (which is certainly related to how much activity an animal has had).</div><a href="#top" class="arrange"> Go to Top</a>

				<div class="content">The genealogy of some of Japan's favorite cuisines can be traced back over a thousand years and beyond their borders. Sushi, the most popular of all Japanese cuisine, has a fascinating history relating to its evolution to what we know today. Sushi's popularity has continued to explode, spreading throughout the United States in the 1970s. Sushi is now a global phenomenon. Japanese cookery has evolved over time and has features that make each item unique and identifiable to their culture. Sushi is such an item. Its sudden rise to popularity brings an interest about sushi's origin, genealogy, and the background history of people and events that changed the methods used to create different styles of Sushi. It's popularity, globalization, and the distinctive differences earmarked by some types of sushi are a growing interest to novice and experienced connoisseurs of sushi. "Sushi has evolved here in the United States. Sushi has come into its own style and culture here, and in some places it's almost considered as American as apple pie. Crazy combinations of ingredients can be found inside sushi rolls, with bizarre names like the Caterpillar roll, Spider roll and Surf's Up roll. </div><a href="#top" class="arrange"> Go to Top</a>
